Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a young girl named Cinderella. She was a kind, gentle, and beautiful child with the most radiant smile. Cinderella had a heart full of love, but unfortunately, fate hadn’t been kind to Cinderella. Her mother had passed away, leaving her alone with her selfish stepmother.

The stepmother had two daughters of her own, and she was terribly jealous of Cinderella’s beauty and kind heart. She treated Cinderella unfairly, making her do all the housework and dress in rags while her own daughters wore fine clothes and lived in luxury.

Despite the cruelty she faced, Cinderella remained kind and gentle, never letting her stepmother’s unkindness change who she was. She would often seek comfort in the garden, talking to the birds and the animals, who had become her dearest friends.

One day, the kingdom received exciting news. The prince was hosting a grand ball at the palace, and every maiden in the land was invited. Cinderella’s stepsisters were overjoyed and spent weeks preparing their gowns and practicing their dance moves.
